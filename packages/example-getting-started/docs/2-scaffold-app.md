### Create your app scaffolding

The LoopBack 4 CLI toolkit comes with templates that allow you to generate
whole applications, as well as artifacts (ex. controllers, models, repositories)
for existing applications.

To generate your application using the toolkit, run the `lb4` command
and follow the on-screen prompts:
```
$ lb4
```

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of terminal here to illustrate what we mean. -->

For this tutorial, when prompted with the options for selecting things like
whether or not to enable certain project features (loopback's build, tslint,
mocha, etc.), leave them all enabled.

When you're ready, we'll begin laying the groundwork for our application by
making use of the [Legacy Juggler](3-add-legacy-juggler.md).
